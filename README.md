## üé® What is Interchain UI?

Interchain UI is a foundation library for UI elements used in [cosmos-kit](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/cosmos-kit) and other packages. It provides developers with pre-built components and a foundation for creating user interfaces across different frameworks, such as VueJS, React, Angular, Svelte, SolidJS, and Web Components, enabling developers to customize UI elements and themes. This gives us the ability to code a component once, and it will compile to all framework targets.

## Usage

```bash
# If you use react
yarn add @interchain-ui/react

# If you use vue
yarn add @interchain-ui/vue
```

### React

To see how to use with react, see our react documentation

[Using React](./docs/react.md)

## Developing

We are using Lerna + PNPM to bootstrap the monorepo. First make sure you install PNPM locally first, then run these commands:

- `pnpm install` to bootstrap the repo
- `pnpm run dev` to watch the repo for changes and then recompile
- `pnpm run compile` to compile from mitosis components to other packages, you can give it a flag `-p` or `--platforms` .ie `pnpm run compile -p react vue`
- `pnpm run c:react` or `pnpm run c:vue` to compile specifically to react or vue
- `pnpm run clear` to clean `.node_modules` or `pnpm run clear:assets` to clean build/compile output
- `pnpm run clear:cache` to clean cache folder used by bundlers

## Overview and structure

![Overview](./docs/overview-ui-kit.png)
We create components inside a single source of truth folder `<root>/src` with Lite JSX format (`.lite.tsx`), then through our compiler, it's going to compile our components and build it in sub packages' `src` and `dist`.

## Compiler

To know more about the inner workings of our compiler, check [Compiler](./docs/compiler.md) to explore.

## Icons

Check [Icon guide](./docs/icons.md) to know how to add more icons

## Customizing theme

Check [Customizing guide](./docs/custom-theme.md) to know how to customize the default theme.

## Package dev scripts in root package.json
- `t:<target>` to compile target framework (t is short for transpile)
- `b:<target>` to bundle target framework
- `c:<target>` to compile and bundle target framework, it's equivalent to sequentially running `pnpm run t:<target> && pnpm run b:<target>`

## Convention

- Component file names must end with `*.lite.tsx`
- Style sheets must be in `*.css.ts` files, this is because we use a styling solution called `vanilla-extract` to have a CSS-in-JS API across all frameworks.
- For a component, you must use default export, not named export. This is a limitation of Mitosis
- There are more rules and limitations, please read more about Mitosis [here](https://github.com/BuilderIO/mitosis/tree/main/docs)
- To quickly test to see the compilation result from one Mitosis to any framework source code, please use
[mitosis sandbox](https://mitosis.builder.io/). It's similar to TS playground but for Mitosis testing purpose.
- [Vue specifics] Event handlers
  - Event handlers in `<template>` must be prefixed with `on`
  - Event handlers must be defined in `useStore` hook with a getter function `get eventHandlers()` with exact name. A template for this is as below:

  ```ts
  get eventHandlers() {
    const handlers: Record<string, (event: any) => void> = {};
    const eventProps = [
      "onClick",
      "onDoubleClick",
      // Add other event names here
    ]
    eventProps.forEach((eventName) => {
        if (props[eventName]) {
          handlers[eventName] = (event: any) => props[eventName](event);
        }
      });

    return handlers;
  }
  ```
  - You can then attach the event handlers to the JSX tag with spread attribute `{...state.eventHandlers}`, this will be transformed to be a `v-on` directive in Vue
